# HTML, CSS, Javascript -- Code Quiz

For the fourth week, we were tasked with using our newer Javascript knowledge and combining that with our HTML and CSS skills. The final result was to create a one-page application that consisted of a timed quiz with multiple choice answers plus a leaderboard.

## About the Project

Code Quiz (LINK TBA)

The quiz itself is a mixture of HTML and Javascript inserting the questions as the user answers and continues to the next screen.

Initially, I wanted to try to have one div that acted like the template for all of the questions that would have the h2 tag include the question, while a ul list would be appended below with the answers.

Will update this.. a lot.

Much of this is still under construction, but will be present in the final product (probably).
