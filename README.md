# HTML, CSS, Javascript -- Code Quiz

For the fourth week, we were tasked with using our newer Javascript knowledge and combining that with our HTML and CSS skills. The final result was to create a one-page application that consisted of a timed quiz with multiple choice answers plus a leaderboard.

## About the Project

Code Quiz (LINK TBA)

The quiz itself is a mixture of HTML and Javascript inserting the questions as the user answers and continues to the next screen.

A goal of this is to add a progress bar that appears at the top of the screen alongside the timer and (local) scores.

Much of this is still under construction, but will be present in the final product (probably).
